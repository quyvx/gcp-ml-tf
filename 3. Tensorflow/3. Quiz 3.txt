1.
What is TensorFlow? (choose all that apply)


== TensorFlow is an open-source high-performance library for numerical computation that uses directed graphs


== TensorFlow is open source

2.
True or False: When you run a TensorFlow graph (like a + b), you immediately get the output of the graph (the sum of a and b)

True - but only if you have tf.eager mode enabled

3.
What do nodes in a TensorFlow graph represent?


Arrays of data


All of the above


== Mathematical operations


Machine Learning

4.
What is a tensor?

== A n-dimensional array of data (generalization of a vector)

5.
True or False: You can only run TensorFlow on Google Cloud

== False

6. 
The iterative process where a TensorFlow model can crowdsource and combine model feedback from individual users is called what?

== Federated learning

7.
What is the high level API that allows for distributed training in TensorFlow?
== tf.estimator

8. 
How do you run a TensorFlow graph?

== Call run() on a tf.Session

9.
Why would you call tf.summary.FileWriter?


== To output statistics and visualize them in a tool like TensorBoard


To write out the trained ML model output into a file for distribution


To output the graph in a human-readable format for sharing

10.
What is the shape of tf.constant([2, 3, 5])?


It's a scalar so it would be (3)


== It's a vector so it would be (3)


It's a vector so it would be (1,3)


It's a scalar so it would be ( )
