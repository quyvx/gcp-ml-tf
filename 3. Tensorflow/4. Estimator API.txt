1. What are some of the key goals of the estimator API?

== All of the above

2. Question 2
What is one of the largest benefits of the estimator API?

== It abstracts away boilerplate code which saves you time

3. Question 3
What is the right way to call a linear regression model with tf.estimator?

== tf.estimator.LinearRegressor

4. Question 4
Inputs to the estimator model are in the form of:

== feature columns

5. Question 5
Numeric inputs can be passed to a linear regressor as-is, but categorical columns are often:

== One-hot encoded

6. Question 6
What is the size of the training dataset (features + labels) in this example?
== 6 rows, 3 columns

7. Question 7
In this example, what extra parameters does the DNNRegressor take that the LinearRegressor doesn't?

== hidden_units

8. Question 8
In what situation do you have to delete the model directory before starting training?

== If you have changed the model structure from the previous time, for example, you used a DNNRegressor with [64,32] last time and now you are using [32, 16]

9. Question 9
What is the difference between steps and max_steps?

== Steps means "train these many additional steps". max_steps means "train up to these many steps total, starting from how many ever steps have been completed so far"
