1. Question 1
You are training a model to predict how long it will take to sell a house. The list price of the house, with numeric $20,000 to $500,000 values, is one of the inputs to the model. Which of these is a good practice?
== Rescale the real valued feature like a price to a range from 0 to 1

2. Question 2
Which of these tools are commonly used for data pre-processing? (Select 3 correct responses)
== Apache Beam
== BigQuery
== TensorFlow

3. Question 3
Which one of these is NOT something you would commonly do in data preprocessing?
== Tune your ML model hyperparameters

4. Question 4
In your TensorFlow model you are calculating the distance between two points on a map as a new feature. How do you ensure the preprocessing you're doing for model training is also do the exact same way in prediction?

== Wrap features in training/evaluation input function AND wrap features in serving input function:

5. Question 5
The below code preprocesses the latitude and longitude using feature columns. What is the point of the 38.0 and 42.0 in the column buckets?
== Latitudes must be between 38 and 42 will be discretized into the specified number of bins.

6. Question 6
What are two advantages of using TensorFlow to preprocess your code instead of building an Apache Beam pipeline? (Select two correct responses)
== In TensorFlow you will have access to helper APIs to help automatically bucketize and process features instead of writing your own java or python code
== In TensorFlow the same pipelines can be used in both training and serving

7. Question 7
What is one key advantage of preprocessing your features using Apache Beam?
== The same code you use to preprocess features in training and evaluation can also be used in serving
