1. Question 1
You are building a model to predict the number of points ("margin") by which Team A will beat Team B in a basketball game. Your input features are (1) whether or not it it is a home game for Team A (2) average number of points Team A scored in its past 7 games and (3) average number of points Team B scored in its past 7 games. Which of these is a linear model suitable for machine learning?

== margin = w1 * is_home + w2 * (avg_points_A - avg_points_B)^3


== margin = b + w1 * is_home_game + w2 * avg_points_A + w3 * avg_points_B


== margin = w1 * is_home + w1^2 * avg_points_A + w1^3 * avg_points_B

2. Question 2
Feature crosses are more common in modern machine learning because:
== Feature crosses memorize, and that is okay only if you have extremely large datasets.

3. Question 3
The function tf.feature_column.crossed_column requires:
== A list of categorical or bucketized features

4. Question 4
You might create an embedding of a feature cross in order to:
== Create a lower-dimensional representation of the input space
== Identify similar sets of inputs for clustering
