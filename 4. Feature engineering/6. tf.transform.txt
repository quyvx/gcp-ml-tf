1. Question 1
What is a common use case for where you would use tf.transform instead of a Cloud Dataflow pipeline or regular TensorFlow for preprocessing?


== You want to scale your inputs based on min/max value in the dataset


You want to invoke on-the-fly preprocessing for ML models based solely on the inputs to a model function as part of your graph


You want to take a rolling-average of the number of cars at an intersection during the last hour


== You need to compute the vocabulary list for categorical columns from your training dataset

3. Question 3
The Transform phase of tf.transform is carried out via:


Inside a Beam pipeline for evaluation and in TensorFlow during training


== Inside a TensorFlow serving input function during prediction


== A Beam pipeline while creating a training or evaluation dataset


Inside a Beam pipeline for training and in TensorFlow during evaluation
